    "This project made me realize to find meaningful ways to be organized, as that is what made everything easier for me to work with. Each aspect has its own job like one handles the data, one saves it to a file, one manages the budget, and one runs everything together. I used self to keep things separate for each part.\n",

    "This project was actually really fun to work on. I spent a lot of time going over the notes again and again just to really understand how everything connects. Since I already had some background in OOP, I decided to take that route and picked the first project because it felt really comfortable. I‚Äôm hoping to give Project 2 a shot later on. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of dealing with file saving and loading, so I kept the file names hardcoded and just played around with CSV and JSON instead. At first, I thought about hardcoding the budget too, but then I realized it wouldn‚Äôt make sense when loading old expense files with their own budgets. So I used a JSON file for that instead. I even tried storing the budget inside the CSV file, but that got messy real fast. My favorite parts were adding expenses and calculating totals or categories. I really enjoyed seeing the results through the CSV. The file management part was the hardest and honestly the most frustrating, but I learned a lot from it. I also had fun writing the user prompts and tried to think of every way Andrew might try to break the program. Ultimately it was a great experience and I learned how important it is to initialize things properly from the start to avoid weird bugs later on."
